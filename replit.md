# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built using React with TypeScript, leveraging Vite as the build tool for optimal development experience and performance. The UI framework utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling with shadcn/ui components providing a consistent, modern design system. Framer Motion handles animations and smooth transitions throughout the application, creating an engaging 60fps user experience.

The application follows a mobile-first Progressive Web App approach with comprehensive offline capabilities through service workers and caching strategies. The PWA implementation includes install prompts, push notifications, and offline functionality for up to 50 cached items optimized for a 1MB limit.

State management is handled through React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state synchronization, with local component state managed via React hooks. The routing system uses Wouter for lightweight client-side navigation.

## Backend Architecture
The server-side architecture is built on Node.js with Express.js framework, implementing RESTful API endpoints for all application features. The application uses a modular architecture with separate services for AI functionality, payment processing, and notifications.

Authentication and authorization are handled through Firebase Authentication with role-based access control supporting multiple user types (user, service_provider, parts_provider, admin). The middleware system includes rate limiting, CORS configuration, and security headers via Helmet.

Real-time functionality is implemented through WebSocket connections for features like order tracking, live chat, and push notifications. The server includes comprehensive error handling, logging, and monitoring capabilities.

## Data Storage Solutions
The primary database is PostgreSQL, managed through Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations. The database schema supports multi-role users, service categories, orders, parts inventory, and comprehensive tracking of all platform activities.

Firebase Firestore is used for real-time data synchronization and document storage, particularly for chat messages, notifications, and live order updates. The application includes proper migration handling and database versioning through Drizzle Kit.

## Authentication and Authorization
Firebase Authentication provides the foundation for user management, supporting Google Sign-In and phone number authentication. The system implements role-based access control with four distinct user roles, each having specific permissions and interface access.

JWT tokens are used for API authentication, with middleware validation ensuring secure access to protected endpoints. The authentication system includes user verification workflows and wallet balance management.

## External Dependencies
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives provide accessible, unstyled components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL for production-ready data storage
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth for user management and authentication
- **Payments**: Stripe integration for payment processing (stubbed in development)
- **AI Services**: OpenRouter API with DeepSeek model for intelligent search and recommendations
- **Maps**: Google Maps integration for location services
- **Real-time**: WebSocket implementation for live updates and chat functionality
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications

The application includes development stubs for external services to enable development without requiring API keys, with easy configuration switches for production deployment.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Twilio OTP Authentication

Integrate Twilio SMS API for sending OTPs to user‚Äôs mobile number.

User enters phone number in a ‚ÄúSign In / Sign Up‚Äù form.

Backend generates a secure 6-digit OTP, sends it via Twilio SMS.

Automatic OTP detection/fill:

If browser supports WebOTP API (on Chrome/Android), automatically read the incoming SMS and auto-fill OTP field.

If not supported, user can manually enter the OTP.


Once OTP is verified, user is marked as authenticated and can proceed to the next step.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Onboarding After Verification

1. Name Input:

After OTP verification, show a form asking the user to enter their Name.

Name is stored in user‚Äôs profile.



2. Automatic Location Selector:

Use HTML5 Geolocation API or Maps API to automatically detect current location (city + area).

Show a map/location selector popup to allow user to confirm or adjust location.

Once confirmed, display the current location at the top of the app UI (e.g., in a header bar).

3Ô∏è‚É£ User Account Details Page

After onboarding, in the Account/Profile page:

Show Name and Mobile Number (from OTP login).

Add an ‚ÄúUpdate Gmail‚Äù option where the user can add or change their Gmail/Email ID.

Ensure changes update in database instantly.
